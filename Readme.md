# Milestone 3
## Recipe creator app

### I decided I wanted to create a recipe app where you could add recipes to your families recipe book.
### This is what I came up with.

# UX
##### This website is for anyone who would like to list out their favorite recipes
##### in an easy to navigate application.

### User stories:
##### As a user I want to be able to read and use recipes that are available to me via the web app
##### As a user I'd like somewhere I could go to add recipes to a list of recipes that I like
##### As a user I'd like somewhere I could keep my recipes for safe keeping

# Features
##### The app features a display page where you can view your already added recipes. It also features an "add recipe" template and an ability to edit or delete recipes.

# Technologies used
##### HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Jinja, Python, MongoDB

# Testing
##### I have yet to find a way to make sure that the "photo url" validates correctly and with defensive programming, offers feedback to a user who wishes to upload a photo if they don't already know how to do so.
##### The site is in good working condition. Maybe provide instructions on a pop up screen in future use.

# Deployment
##### I deployed the application to Heroku and github via gitpod with the pre-ordained setup Code Institute has set up for us in our projects.

# Acknowledgments
##### I used the "Task Manager" demo videos for a lot of my inspiration and know-how to do the project. The code is similar but it isn't copied.

# Media
##### The photos and body copy used for the recipes that already exist on the web app were taken from www.weelicious.com and their respective recipes already listed on the website.
